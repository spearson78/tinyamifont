    This file includes two bitmap fonts for Amiga:

    - micropaz/6 (a 6x6 font)
    - nanopaz/6  (a 4x6 font)

    Both are still readable (in fact, 4x6 is the limit for readable
 fonts) and there's a lot os uses you can have with them, such as..
 for example.. ... er.. well..

    Ah.. Imagine a 320x200 Workbench with 80 column text! :)

    You can use it on math plan so it can hold much more data on
 screen simultaneously.. the number characters are very clear to read.


    Installation instructions: just copy the files inside the 'Fonts'
 drawer to respective places in FONTS: assignment.



    Enjoy! (microscope not included)
