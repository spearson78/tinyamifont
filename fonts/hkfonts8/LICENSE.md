HK Fonts volume 8

© 1995, 1996 Heikki Kantola

Introduction

After a long wait I've finally managed to create yet another font collection,
although in order to enlarge the archive a bit, I've decided to also include
some icons in it which results that the name HK Fonts is bit misleading, but as
I couldn't think of any better one, I still call this collection HK Fonts too.
If you've better suggestion, please contact me.

Contents

Fonts

This collection includes the following fonts, which I've designed with the quite
nice Typeface font editor by David Kinder except the already previously released
sizes of Digital Quill, which were made with ye olde FED from the Extras
1.3-disk.

 * Digital Quill (9x6,11x6,16x8)

As mentioned above, I've already released 9 and 11 point sizes of 	this quite
plain and normal looking sans serif font earlier in HK 	Fonts 7. Name comes 
from the great text editor Digital Quill by Timothy "Timmer" Aston.
 
 * Foobar (11pt and 13pt proportional)

No big thrills here either, yet another normal looking thin sans serif font.
 
 * Marble (12pt proportional)

Timmer requested 12pt Times-like font as he said 11pt was too small and 13pt
too big, so I took the challence and created this serif font (no it isn't
exactly Times ;)).

 * Space Age (13pt proportional)

If you've remember Star Age font from HK Fonts 	7, you'll notice that this font
actually shares bit more than just Age in name as Space Age actually is basicly 
proportionalized version of Star Age.

 * Unga Bunga (13pt proportional)

Osma "Tau" Ahvenlampi once requested something like this - 13pt, proportional, 
bold font.

Icons

As a extra I decided to include these MagicWB-style icons with the fonts. Apart
from the Mosaic icon, I've designed these fonts with Chad Randall's superb
Iconian icon editor mostly by combining some old icons.

I've sorted the icons into following groups:

KMI-dock

These are (ToolManager) dock icons for some nice networking applications in
style set by Kochtopfh in his KMI icon collection and later used by Tau and 
few others.

 * AmiFTP.KMI-dock

For Magnus Lilja's AmiFTP.

 * AWeb.KMI-dock

For Yvon Rozijn's awesome WWW-browser AWeb.

 * Unix_Shell

This icon suits NäpsäTerm or some other window-based terminal emulators.

 * Voodoo.dockicon

For the Voodoo Amiga Multimedia E-Mailer by Osma "Tau" Ahvenlampi.

Misc

These are icons which are neither KMI-style dock icons nor for preferences
programs.

 * Mosaic

For AMosaic.
I didn't draw this icon myself, I got it on IRC from somebody, 	whose name I've
sadly already forgotten. :( I decided to release it in this collection without
his permission (as I couldn't remember from whom to ask :)) as I really think
it's nicelooking icon which deserves wider audience even as AMosaic is now
getting somewhat outdated compared to other Amiga WWW browsers.

 * NewEdit

As string gadget keycommad enchancer NewEdit lacked MagicWB-icon I whipped up
this little one.

 * ReqChangeCX

Another commodity missing MagicWB-icon I decided to make one.

 * Tank-drawer

Image drawer with tiny tank. Suits war games and like.

Prefs

I've included in this archive the following prefences program icons:

 * AMprefs
 
For AMosaic preferences. Basicly just same icon as Mosaic with just the usual question mark
to show it's prefs program.

 * CrossDOS

 * DTprefs

For datatype preferences program.

 * Translator

For translator.library V42's prefs program.

Installation

I'm afraid it has to be done manually as I've been too lazy to write 
Installer®-script for this collection, but it shouldn't be too hard. In order 
to install the fonts just copy the contents of fonts-drawer of this collection 
to your FONTS: and you're all set. Installing the icons isn't quite that simple
though, as if you just copy the info-files over the old ones you may loose the
tooltypes and default tools of the old icons, therefor I suggest to use some
specialized icon-copier (there are several on Aminet) or David Swasbrook's 
excelent WorkBench's Info-function enchancer SwazInfo to do the job.

Legal Mumbo Jumbo

The fonts in this collection are GIFTWARE. This means that you may freely
distribute them as long as no more than substancial fee for media, copying
and/or p&p is charged, but if you use these fonts you should send the author a
GIFT  - money, delicacy, software, hardware (graphics cards, A4000Ts, UNIX®
workstations and so on) or something else useful. You may not  include these
fonts on magazine cover disks or shareware/commercial products without prior
consultation with the author.(it's me who's supposed to gain profit from these
fonts, after all!).

The icons included in this collection are FREEWARE (I think I can say so, even
as I haven't consulted the author of Mosaic-icon).

The Author

 The author of these fonts and the icons, except the Mosaic-icon, is Heikki
Kantola, computational linguistics student at the University of Helsinki, Amiga
freak, HTML purist, author of HK Fonts volumes 1-8, idler extraordinare, UNIX &
X fan, M$ loather, Mac basher and what else?

How to contact?

 Easiest way to contact me is to send e-mail to Heikki.Kantola@IKI.FI or spot me
on IRC where I'm usually found under nickname Hezu. If you're one of those poor 
ones without Internet access or going to send me a gift, write the following 
addresses in the top of the card/envelope/package:

Heikki Kantola
Sakarinkatu 3 A 17
FIN-00500 Helsinki
Finland

Greetings and thanks.

 First I like to send my warm thanks to the two persons (hmpf, how come there
isn't more of them?!? :( ) who have given me gifts for the previous HK Fonts
volumes, namely Viljo "_3V_" Viitanen who once upon a time donated me 1l of 
orange juice and Pauli Porkka who gave me free registeration of his DAS Mod 
Player once I notified him that one of the fonts shown in the preview pics 
was one of my giftware fonts... ;)

 I also want to greet the all the nice people with whom I've have been hanging
around on IRC, especially the ones who have been kind and let me betetest the
nice programs they have written (I'm not demanding them to send gift as
beta/registered versions I've got are good enough gifts).
