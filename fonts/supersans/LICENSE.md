"Super Sans Serif" is an very clean and readable "Sans Serif"-type
of standard non-fixed width Amiga bitmap-font, similar to fonts like
Arial, Helvetica, Tahoma etc. Main features include:

- Light, clean, eye-friendly looking
- Every Western character included, even the new Euro-symbol!
  ((128 decimal/$80 hex) Don't ask me what the key-combination for
  that symbol is. I have no idea!)
- Very good as Workbench Screen/Icon-text font. Also useful in many
  applications able to use standard non-fixed width Amiga bitmap-fonts
- Doesn't take to much unnecessary space on screen.


Requirements: Nothing besides an Amiga with AmigaOS.

              You don't need any extra software or harware to use this
              font.

              VISUALPREFS, if you choose to download/install/
              configurate/and use it, needs an Amiga with AmigaOS 3.0+

Suggestion:   You can use VISUALPREFS to change the height of the
              titlebars so that the "Super Sans Serif"-font looks
              better when using 'Super Sans Serif/14' as the Workbench
              ScreenText font.

              VISUALPREFS can be downloaded from Aminet.
              http://aminet.net/aminet/util/wb/VisualPrefs.lha

              A display mode square (1:1) pixels is strongly suggested
              if you want to use VISUALPREFS, as well as a screen
              resolution of 640x400 or more.

              Feel free to change your titlebar height to any height
              you prefer. I have set my titlebar to this height when
              I using size 14 of "Super Sans Serif"-font:

              Window=1  Screen=1

              I suggest that you should use size 13 rather than size
              14 because it takes less room on screen and it's
              slightly faster too. The only difference between size
              13 and 14 is an extra empty pixel at the bottom of size
              14 resulting in one extra pixel of linespace.

History:      Date: 000720  -  Fixed some irritating space problems
                               with some of the characters in size 13
                               and 14.

              Date: 000714  -  Drawed size 9

              Date: 000709  -  Drawed size 11

              Date: 000703  -  The font got much better kerning than
                               before.

                               Cutted away unnecessary space from the
                               height. The new size 13 is identical to
                               the new version of size 14 except that
                               size 14 has an empty extra pixel at the
                               bottom so that the linespacing is
                               extended by one pixel.

              Date: 000618  -  First Aminet upload.

Future:       Maybe add more font-sizes
