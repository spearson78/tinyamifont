The font "Voyager" was made from a helvetica-like font "helvetish1" for the
use  in  WEB-Browser  "Voyager3.1".  I've  completed  in all sizes the full
ISO-Latin charset. So these fonts are useable for each language,  that  use
the latin font.

The fonts called "alfa..." are made new as fixed fonts. They are also  good
useable for the WEB-Browser.

All fonts are made for the best legibility in all sizes.

All fonts are Freeware. Use them, if you like them ... :))

Simple copy the fonts in your FONTS:-directory.
