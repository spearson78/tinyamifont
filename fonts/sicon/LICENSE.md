     This font works great for 640x400 resolution screens, but kinda' tiny for
any of the studly-24bit-super-resolutions. The character mapping is the same as
Topaz, so all of the international letters should be there. Comments,
suggestions
or queries welcomed!

     Thanks to David Kinder and his wonderful font editor TypeFace 1.2.
