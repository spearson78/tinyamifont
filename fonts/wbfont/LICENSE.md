This archive contains some fonts suitable for a proportional Workbench
(i.e., one with square pixels, like Super72, DblPAL, or PAL/Laced).

I've always been annoyed by the lack of nice non-proportional fonts.
Topaz is fat and ugly in 800x600, Courier is just ugly.  The XEN font
from MagicWB is decent, but it didn't come in the size I wanted.  I wasn't
terribly happy with the choices available for icon fonts, either.
Helvetica/9 (or the almost identical XHelvetica/9) is too small; the
lower-case letters are only four pixels high, which means the a's and e's
and other complex little letters look strange.  And the 11-point fonts are
too tall... what I really wanted was a better 9 point proportional font.

So I created some fonts on my own, with fed and later fm.

clean is the non-proportional font.  It's designed to resemble a
Helvetica font as closely as possible -- the A is shaped like an
upside-down V (and not an upside-down U), for instance.  Sizes available:
9x6, 10x6, 11x6, and 13x7 pixels.  The size of an E is 7x5, 7x5, 8x5, and
9x6, respectively.

IconFont is the icon text font, of course.  (Though I suppose if you
have a 17" monitor and like small fonts, you can use it as the Screen Font,
too... I use it as the `tiny' font in MUI.)  It's very similar to the
Helvetica font, but the characters are bigger and much more legible IMO.
Size: 9 pixels, proportional.

I made these fonts more than a year ago, but as I recently got a request
for them by someone who saw a grab of my Workbench Screen, I decided to
upload them.  Better late than never... and before uploading them, I
filled in all the ü's and è's and ñ's and so on wherever they were
missing.  Which is why the timestamp is relatively fresh on some of the
fonts.
