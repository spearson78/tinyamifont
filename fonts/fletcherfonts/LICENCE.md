        		  PD Soft Presents

	              Colour Fonts Pack Volume 1


	Thankyou for purchasing PD Soft`s "FLETCHER FONTS". On this pack of 
six disks you will find a varied assortment of coloured fonts.

	This compilation of Fonts is Licenceware from PD Soft, although
the fonts, to the best of our knowledge are Public Domain we would 
appreciate that you could leave these disks intact and use them as a set
of ready to use fonts.

	For those of you who are not to familiar with the use of Fonts
other than those supplied with DPaint III, I will briefly outline how 
to use these fonts.

	The first thing you must do when loading DPaint, is to load the
colour text wedge in the Dpaint window, once loaded this is indicated
on the top of the screen, you may now proceed to load Dpaint in the
normal manner.

	When you have got Dpaint up and running, select the Font
requestor with the Right Button on the Mouse, you will now be presented
with the Font Selection Window.
