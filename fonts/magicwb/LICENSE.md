This is the  official  new  shareware  version of MagicWB 2.  Use it if you
still have the old  and outdated  MagicWB 1.2p running on your system or if
you don't have MagicWB installed at all... :)

The  definite  WB-Enhancer  no  Amiga  can do without.   MagicWB  is a full
replacement  for  the  graphic  user interface of the Workbench and has be-
come  the standard on the Amiga.  MagicWB 2.x is completely restructured on
a  new  color-allocation scheme which more than doubles the speed of the WB
and  reduces  chip-consumption  to  only a third compared with all previous
versions  and  also  features  a  highly  improved  color palette.  MWB 2.x
introduces  a  never-before-seen  standard  for  over  four  dozen  of  new
image-drawers  to  achieve a more diversified look on your WB.  More icons,
dock-brushes, a dozen of new patterns, fonts and a AA-support complete this
special product.

This  is  version 2.1p, the freely distributable public version ('p' stands
for 'public').  MagicWB is shareware:  You  are  allowed  to  evaluate this
version  for  a  period of 14 days.  After that you have to register if you
continue using it.

This  version  is  fully  installable  and  usable, hence you can very much
evaluate  if  you like MagicWB or not and if it's worth to register it.  By
installing   this  version  you  are  also  updating  to  the  new  MagicWB
color-allocation  scheme which makes you compatible with other applications
using  MWB.  After this installation no graphics, icons  etc. should appear
in  the  wrong  colors  again.  And the icon build-up and general workbench
performance will be much faster than before.
